# 📊 Superstore Sales Analysis — Advanced Excel

**Program:** Professional Certificate in Business Analytics & Consulting — upGrad × PwC Academy  
**Domain:** Retail Analytics  
**Tool:** Microsoft Excel

---

## 🎯 Project Objective

Analyse transactional sales data from a Canadian retail superstore to identify profitable and loss-making product sub-categories across four distinct customer segments. Deliver the findings as a structured, management-ready Excel report with visualisations and recommendations that directly inform inventory and pricing strategy.

This project simulates a core analyst task: receiving a raw sales dataset and producing a polished, decision-ready deliverable — the kind of output expected in business operations, consulting, or data analyst roles.

## 💼 Business Problem

The retail management team needed clarity on:
- Which product sub-categories are generating profits vs. losses, broken down by region?
- How do the four customer segments — Corporate, Consumer, Home Office, Small Business — differ in purchasing patterns and profitability?
- Where should inventory investment be increased, maintained, or pulled back?

## 📂 Dataset

**Source:** Sample Superstore dataset (publicly available educational dataset — part of Tableau's public sample data library, widely used across analytics programs)  
**Records:** ~9,994 orders  
**Scope:** Canadian retail chain across multiple regions and provinces  
**Key Fields:** Order ID, Customer Segment, Region, Province, Category, Sub-Category, Sales, Profit, Quantity, Discount

## 🔍 Analysis Performed

### Report Construction & Formatting
- Filtered and organised data across 4 separate customer segment tabs
- Applied **conditional formatting**: top 10% sales highlighted; profit/loss gradient (green = profit → red = loss)
- Multi-level sorting: Region → Province → Sales (descending) for structured readability
- Professional page layout configured for print-ready reporting
- Used **VLOOKUP** to cross-reference and combine product-level information across sheets

### Business Insights via Pivot Tables
- Built Pivot Tables identifying **Top 3 most profitable sub-categories per region**
- Identified **most loss-making sub-categories** across all regions and segments
- Compared average order values and profit margins across customer segments

---

## 📈 Key Findings

- **Copiers** were the most consistently profitable sub-category across all regions
- **Tables** recorded the largest losses — particularly concentrated in the Central region
- **Phones** and **Accessories** were strong performers in East and West respectively
- The Home Office segment showed the highest average order value despite lower transaction volume
- Discount patterns in underperforming categories were directly correlated with margin erosion

---

## 💡 Business Recommendations

1. **Discontinue or restructure Tables pricing** in Central — losses are not offset by volume
2. **Increase promotional investment in Copiers and Phones** — highest and most consistent margins
3. **Introduce table-chair bundle offers** to improve Tables category contribution via cross-sell
4. **Segment-specific inventory planning** — product mix should differ between regions, not follow a one-size approach
