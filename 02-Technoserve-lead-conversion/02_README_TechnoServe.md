**Program:** Professional Certificate in Business Analytics & Consulting — upGrad × PwC Academy  
**Domain:** B2B Technology Sales Analytics  
**Tools:** Microsoft Excel · PowerPoint

---

## 🎯 Project Objective

Apply structured business consulting frameworks to analyse TechnoServe's lead conversion data — identifying the key drivers that determine whether a sales opportunity is won or lost. Deliverables included both a rigorous data analysis and an executive-level presentation structured using the Pyramid Principle, simulating the output expected from a business analyst or associate consultant.

## 💼 Business Problem

TechnoServe's leadership needed to understand:
- What factors — technology offering, sales channel, client size, prior relationship — most determine lead conversion?
- Where should the sales team concentrate resources to maximise win rates?
- How can the business move from intuition-led to data-driven sales prioritisation?

## 🔍 Methodology

### Phase 1 — Problem Structuring
Applied consulting frameworks to structure the business question before touching the data:
- **5Ws Framework** — defined what we're solving, for whom, and why it matters
- **Issue Tree** — decomposed "Why do leads convert?" into testable branches
- **SPIN & Business Model Canvas** — understood TechnoServe's sales motion and value proposition

Hypotheses formulated:
- H1: Cloud and modern tech offerings convert at higher rates than legacy system proposals
- H2: Direct sales outperforms channel/partner-led approaches for high-value deals
- H3: Mid-market client revenue bands show the highest conversion efficiency
- H4: Existing clients convert significantly more than new cold prospects

### Phase 2 — Data Analysis
- Applied the **Five Patterns of Insights** framework (Trends, Comparisons, Breakdowns, Correlations, Outliers)
- Segmented conversion rates across all four key hypothesis variables
- Created cross-tab analyses and derived conversion rate columns per segment
- Validated or invalidated each hypothesis using data — not assumption

### Phase 3 — Storytelling & Presentation
- Structured findings using the **Pyramid Principle** (key conclusion → supporting arguments → evidence)
- Built executive-level visualisations for C-suite presentation
- Recommendations framed with projected business impact, not just observations

---

## 📈 Key Findings

- Existing client relationships drove approximately **4× higher conversion** than cold prospects — the strongest predictor in the dataset
- Cloud-first technology proposals significantly outperformed legacy system pitches on conversion rate
- Direct sales exceeded partner-led channels by double-digit percentage points for large deals
- Mid-market clients showed the best conversion efficiency — enterprise deals had higher value but lower close rates

---

## 💡 Strategic Recommendations

1. **Shift to account expansion model** — dedicate sales capacity to growing existing relationships, not just new logo acquisition
2. **Lead with cloud and modern tech positioning** — frame legacy modernisation as a secondary upsell, not the primary pitch
3. **Reduce channel partner dependency** on high-value deals — direct sales ownership improves outcome
4. **Build a simple lead scoring model** using existing relationship status, client revenue size, and tech interest as primary inputs
